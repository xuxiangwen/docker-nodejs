This Abe recipe demonstrates how to setup abe-elasticsearch plugin and use it on the frontend

![Screenshot](/site/screenshot.png?raw=true)

# Installation
1. git clone https://github.com/abecms/recipe-elasticsearch.git
2. cd recipe-elasticsearch
3. abe install abecms/abe-elasticsearch
4. Once you have an elasticsearch instance ready, configure abe.json and the templates using elasticsearch (jquery-autocomplete and jquery-livesearch) with the host and port of your elasticsearch instance.
4. abe serve
5. open your browser at the address : <http://localhost:3000/abe/plugin/abe-elasticsearch/console> and index the blog with your elasticsearch
6. Enjoy ! (go to the site on <http://localhost:3000/autocomplete.html> or <http://localhost:3000/livesearch.html> to see elasticsearch in action)

# Description
In this demo, you'll see 
- different templates illustrating Elasticsearch usage (auto-complete, live search)
- the Elasticsearch console

These templates uses jquery and jquery-ui to query elasticsearch. The usage of jquery and elasticsearch are not directly related to Abe. It's an illustration of how you can add a search engine on your Abe static website: Using the plugin abe-elasticsearch, each time a contributor publish a content from the Abe editor, this content is indexed by an Elasticsearch instance and available on your front.

You'll find also "default" templates (index and single) to create regular content and you'll find already published content to ease your discovery. Don't hesitate to add content and test with this recipe.
You'll also find a notindexed.html template and already created not-indexed-content.html which illustrates content that won't be indexed by Elasticsearch. (Please refer to the plugin configuration to see how you configure specific templates for indexation).

# Installation
Before enjoying the demo, you must have an elasticsearch instance available. The default configuration in abe.json looks for an instance at 127.0.0.1:9200
Change the abe.json config if your elasticsearch instance is located elsewhere.

Don't forget to add the cors config to your config/elasticsearch.yml in your elasticsearch server installation (see details here:https://github.com/abecms/abe-elasticsearch)

Once done, index the Abe published content (some articles are already published) with you elasticsearch instance: <http://localhost:3000/abe/plugin/abe-elasticsearch/console> click on the "index" button.

Once done, all the published posts are indexed in Elasticsearch. If you create a new content and publish it, it will be automatically indexed. Note : If you have listed authorized templates in the elasticsearch config of abe.json, only contents associated with these templates will be indexed.

# The autocomplete template
name:jquery-autocomplete
This template includes a partial containing jquery + jquery-ui autocomplete which requests your elasticsearch instance.

A published post already exist: autocomplete.html but you can create your own post. You can also create a partial to add this search feature on all pages.

## How it works
The search query search the term in the Abe fields "article_content", "article_title" and "abe_meta.template"

```
var postData = {
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "fields": ["article_content", "article_title", "abe_meta.template"], 
      "query": request.term.toLowerCase() + "*"
    }
  }
}
```
The ajax request then use this query. Note in the "url" that we query localhost:9200. Note also "recipe-elasticsearch_single". This last entry is the name of your project directory + the template you want to search. This name has been used to create an index in your elasticsearch (you can change the name of the index by providing a name in abe.json).
On success, we get the item._source.article_title as label and item_id as id.

```
$.ajax({
  url: "http://localhost:9200/recipe-elasticsearch/_search",
  method: "POST",
  crossDomain: true,
  dataType: "JSON",
  data: JSON.stringify(postData),
  success: function(data) {
    response($.map(data.hits.hits, function(item) {
      return {
        label: item._source.article_title,
        id: item._id
      }
    }));
  },
});
```

If you want to request contents from several templates:

```
$.ajax({
  url: "http://localhost:9200/recipe-elasticsearch_single,recipe-elasticsearch_another-template,recipe-elasticsearch_a-third-template/_search",
  method: "POST",
  crossDomain: true,
  dataType: "JSON",
  data: JSON.stringify(postData),
  success: function(data) {
    response($.map(data.hits.hits, function(item) {
      return {
        label: item._source.article_title,
        id: item._id
      }
    }));
  },
});
```

# The livesearch template
name:jquery-livesearch
This template uses jquery to live search blog posts on your elasticsearch instance.

A published post already exist: livesearch.html
create your own and try to create a partial you'll use on your header.

## How it works
The search query (see above for explanation):
```
var postData = {
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "fields": ["article_content", "article_title", "abe_meta.template"], 
      "query": txt + "*"
    }
  }
}
```

The URL we're searching on is composed by:

```
$.ajax({  
  url: "http://localhost:9200/recipe-elasticsearch_single,recipe-elasticsearch_notindexed/_search",
  ...
```
This part ```recipe-elasticsearch_single,recipe-elasticsearch_notindexed```means that we're searching on documents associated with only 2 types of templates:
- recipe-elasticsearch_single
- recipe-elasticsearch_notindexed

You can remove this part if your elasticsearch's cluster is dedicated to your blog. It will then search on the whole content:
```
$.ajax({  
 Â url: "http://localhost:9200/_search",
  ...
```

or you can searchn on several templates (the separator being a comma) or only one, as you like:
```
$.ajax({  
  url: "http://localhost:9200/recipe-elasticsearch_single/_search",
  ...
```

On success, we format the result to display it has a table:
```
success:function(data)  
{ 
  var res= "<div class='table-responsive'><table class='table table bordered'>";
  $.map(data.hits.hits, function(item) {
    res += "<tr>"
    res += "<td><a href='" + item._source.abe_meta.link + "'>" + item._source.article_title + "</a></td>"
    res += "<td>" + item._source.article_content + "</td>"
    res += "<td><img src='" + item._source.article_main_image + "' width='250'/></td>"
    res += "</tr>"
  })
  res += "</table></div>"
  $('#result').html(res);  
}
```

# The abe-elasticsearch plugin console
<http://localhost:3000/abe/plugin/abe-elasticsearch/console>

You'll be able to index or reindex your whole Abe website in a breeze. As soon as the index is finished, you'll be able to search your content on your Elasticsearch instance from the front.
